# Problem.
Today, a large part of video games is designed to be played in multiplayer format, so in some cases it is difficult to find people to complete the places available in a video game, especially when it comes to lonely people, this affects not only beginner players, but a large part of the gamer population. Although there are groups or forums where people who need equipment can find teammates, it is still a problem, since not everyone has access to these groups.

# Solution.
Video Game Match.

The solution we propose to this problem is an application similar to tinder, where you can perform a real-time search for players who are also looking for equipment, in this case the application is aimed at over 18 years, which means that it will be an application with few limitations. The idea of this application is to generate a match when a user is looking for team partners and can decide whether or not to match with this player. It will also have an option to link accounts to have access to the platforms used by this player, so this will be an ideal application for those who are looking for teammates.
