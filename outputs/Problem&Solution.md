# Problem.
Today, a large part of video games is designed to be played in a multiplayer format, so in some cases, it is difficult to find people to complete the places available in a video game, especially when it comes to lonely people, this affects not only beginner players until a large part of the gamer population. Although there are groups or forums where people who need can find teammates, it is still a problem, since not everyone has access to these groups.

# Solution.
Video Game Match.

The solution we propose to this problem is an application similar to tinder, where you can perform a real-time search for players who are also looking for teammates, in this case, the application is aimed at those over 18 years, which means that it will be an application with few limitations. This application seeks to generate a match when a user is looking for team partners and can decide whether or not to match with this player. It will also have the option to link accounts to access the platforms used by this player, so this will be an ideal application for those looking for teammates.
