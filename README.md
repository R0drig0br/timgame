## Team Role Identification:
To optimize and ease the project development were assigned roles to each member of the team which they will be divided and assigned the most adequate tasks the the respective roles.
The team is a group of 3 people who are going to work under one of three roles, being this  project manager, analyst and designer:

## Project manager:
Member: [**Rodrigo Brevis**](https://github.com/R0drig0br)

Team member in charge of the project management and leadership. Responsible for planning, leading and taking the necessary decisions  so that the team can adequately do their tasks. Also is responsible for the respective presentations for each advance of the project.

## Analysts:
Members: [**Andy Sandoval**](https://github.com/andysandoval)

Team members in charge of identifying the product needs and requirements. They are responsible for the process related to acquiring and interpreting the information that is valuable for the project development like defining personas, functionality definition and proposals formalization.

## Designer:
Member: [**Nicolas Rivas**](https://github.com/nrivas03)

Team member in charge of the main content that is going to be evaluated in the project. Responsible for the design process, planification, and interface creation. This task can be the creation of wireframes, mockups and the result of these as a finished interface.

# Problem identification.

Today, a large part of video games is designed to be played in a multiplayer format, so in some cases, it is difficult to find people to complete the places available in a video game, especially when it comes to lonely people, this affects not only beginner players until a large part of the gamer population. Although there are groups or forums where people who need can find teammates, it is still a problem, since not everyone has access to these groups.

## Value Proposal Canvas

The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.

![Canvas](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/main/outputs/Canvas/Value_Proposition_Canvas.png)

After making this value canvas, we could propose a solution.

# Solution proposal.

Video Game Match.

The solution we propose to this problem is an application similar to tinder, where you can perform a real-time search for players who are also looking for teammates, in this case, the application is aimed at those over 18 years, which means that it will be an application with few limitations. This application seeks to generate a match when a user is looking for team partners and can decide whether or not to match with this player. It will also have the option to link accounts to access the platforms used by this player, so this will be an ideal application for those looking for teammates.

# Scope

## UX_Persona

After defining our product strategy, is important to define a scope.  To help us, we create 3 UX_Persona, they were the ideal customer for our app and this helped us to define the scope of design.

![Persona UX 1](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/65a33250c1eec5a73ed08f9941754c764f05e452/outputs/Person%20UX/UX%20Persona-1.png)

## Benchmarking 

Then, we made a Benchmarking, looking for the principal competitors, this gave us an idea of what requirements we have to realize to be a real 
competitors.

# Structure 
In this step, we define de Navigation of our app, using a Navigation Diagram, this helps us to realize the Wireframes and the final interfaces.

Our navigation diagram has many changes in relation to the previous one, which you can see [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/main/source/Navigation%20Diagram.png), but after many suggestions, we have changed that Diagram to the next:

# HD_Interfaces
These interfaces are based on the wireframes, but after receiving many suggestions we made changes to our interfaces. You can see the wireframes here
You can see the wireframes [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/tree/main/outputs/Wireframes)

This is the High_Definition Interfaces, you can see the details in the next [folder](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/tree/main/outputs/Interfaces%20HD)
