## Team Role Identification:
To optimize and facilitate the development of the project, different roles were assigned to each team member.

## Project manager:
Member: [**Rodrigo Brevis**](https://github.com/R0drig0br)

Team member in charge of the project management and leadership. Responsible for planning, leading and taking the necessary decisions  so that the team can adequately do their tasks. Also is responsible for the respective presentations for each advance of the project.

## Analysts:
Members: [**Andy Sandoval**](https://github.com/andysandoval)

Team members in charge of identifying the product needs and requirements. They are responsible for the process related to acquiring and interpreting the information that is valuable for the project development like defining personas, functionality definition and proposals formalization.

## Designer:
Member: [**Nicolas Rivas**](https://github.com/nrivas03)

Team member in charge of the main content that is going to be evaluated in the project. Responsible for the design process, planification, and interface creation. This task can be the creation of wireframes, mockups and the result of these as a finished interface.

# Problem identification.

Today, a large part of video games are designed to be played in multiplayer format, so in some cases, it is difficult to find people to complete the available slots in a video game, especially when it comes to lonely people, this affects not only beginner players, but comes to affect almost most people who simply like to play in this mode. Although there are groups or forums where people in need can find teammates, it is still a problem, as not everyone has access to these groups.

# Strategy

## Value Proposal Canvas

The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.

![Canvas](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/main/outputs/Canvas/Value_Proposition_Canvas.png)

After this value canvas has been completed, we will propose our solution.

## Solution proposal.

Video Game Match.

The solution we propose to this problem is an application similar to tinder, where you can perform a real-time search for players who are also looking for teammates, in this case, the application is aimed at those over 18 years, which means that it will be an application with few limitations. This application seeks to generate a match when a user is looking for team partners and can decide whether or not to match with this player. It will also have the option to link accounts to access the platforms used by this player, so this will be an ideal application for those looking for teammates.

# Scope

## UX_Persona

After defining our product strategy, is important to define a scope.  To help us, we create 3 UX_Persona, they were the ideal customer for our app and this helped us to define the scope of design.

![Persona UX 1](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/65a33250c1eec5a73ed08f9941754c764f05e452/outputs/Person%20UX/UX%20Persona-1.png)

## User Journey Map

By using the UX Persona tool, we were able to understand what are the main needs that our users will have and how they feel when a problem arises or something happens that they do not like. With the above observations, we concluded through a User Journey Map how our users will react when using the application.

## Benchmarking 

Then, we made a Benchmarking, looking for the principal competitors, this gave us an idea of what requirements we have to realize to be a real 
competitors.

# Structure 
In this step, we define de Navigation of our app, using a Navigation Diagram, this helps us to realize the Wireframes and the final interfaces.

Our navigation diagram has many changes in relation to the previous one, which you can see [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/blob/main/source/Navigation%20Diagram.png), but after many suggestions, we have changed that Diagram to the next:

# Skeleton

You can view our initially created wireframes [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/tree/main/outputs/Wireframes)

# Surface

## HD_Interfaces

The interfaces created were made from the wireframes shown above, plus changes were made to the views based on the comments and suggestions made in a heuristic cross evaluation, and we tried to include most of the suggestions and recommendations resulting in the interfaces shown below.

You can see the details in the next [folder](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/tree/main/outputs/Interfaces%20HD)

## Assistive Technologies
Another initiative we propose is to include assistive technologies for visually impaired people. As our application is focused on people who spend many hours in front of a screen, we decided to make views that help these people, we include 2 of these technologies. The first one, is for people who have problems perceiving some colors, for this reason we chose to use a more neutral and opaque color. The second technology we implemented is for people who cannot see very small words, allowing the user to choose the font size that suits them best.

You can see more details of these views in the following [folder](https://github.com/andysandoval/timgame/tree/main/outputs/Interfaces%20HD/007_Assistive_technologies)
