User experience design for TimGame App - Find videogame teammates easier.

## Team Role Identification:
To optimize and ease the project development were assigned roles to each member of the team which they will be divided and assigned the most adequate tasks the the respective roles.
The team is a group of 3 people who are going to work under one of three roles, being this  project manager, analyst and designer:

## Project manager:

Team member in charge of the main content that is going to be evaluated in the project. Responsible for the design process, planification, and interface creation. This task can be the creation of wireframes, mockups and the result of these as a finished interface.

# Problem identification.

Today, a large part of video games is designed to be played in a multiplayer format, so in some cases, it is difficult to find people to complete the places available in a video game, especially when it comes to lonely people, this affects not only beginner players until a large part of the gamer population. Although there are groups or forums where people who need can find teammates, it is still a problem, since not everyone has access to these groups.

##Value Proposal Canvas

The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.

# Solution proposal.

Video Game Match.

The solution we propose to this problem is an application similar to tinder, where you can perform a real-time search for players who are also looking for teammates, in this case, the application is aimed at those over 18 years, which means that it will be an application with few limitations. This application seeks to generate a match when a user is looking for team partners and can decide whether or not to match with this player. It will also have the option to link accounts to access the platforms used by this player, so this will be an ideal application for those looking for teammates.
